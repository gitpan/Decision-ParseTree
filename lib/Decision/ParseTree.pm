=head1 NAME

Decision::ParseTree - Replacing waterfall IF-ELSIF-ELSE blocks

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Death to long if-elsif-else blocks that are  hard to maintain, and hard to 
explain to your manager. Heres an overly simplistic example:

=head2 OLD CODE

   if ( $obj->is_numeric ) {
      if ( $obj->is_positve ) {
         print 'Positive Number';
      } 
      elsif ( $obj->is_negative ) 
         print 'Negative Number';
      }
      else {
         print 'Looks like zero';
      }
   else {
      print 'Non-Numeric Value';
   }

=head2 NEW CODE

=head3 YAML Decision Tree

   ---
      - is_num : 
         0 : Non-Numeric Value
         1 : - is_pos :
               1 : Positive Number
             - is_neg :
               = : Looks like zero
               1 : Negative Number
   ...



=head3 Rules Object

   package Rules;
   use Scalar::Util;
  
   sub is_num { 
      my ( $self, $obj ) = @_;
      return (Scalar::Util::looks_like_number($obj->{value})) ? 1 : 0; 
   }

   sub is_pos { 
      my ( $self, $obj ) = @_;
      return ($obj->{value} > 0 ) ? 1 : 0; 
   }

   sub is_neg { 
      my ( $self, $obj ) = @_;
      return ($obj->{value} < 0 ) ? 1 : 0; 
   }

=head3 Object to be passed

   package Number;
   
   sub new {
      my ( $class, $value ) = @_
      my $self = { parse_path => [], 
                   value => $value };
      return bless $self, $class;
   }
   
   


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 YAML as a Decision tree

To make this all work we need a few parts:

=over

=item * A rules object: This will be a library of rules.

=item * An object that will be passed thru the rules.

=item * A YAML doc that outlines your decision tree.

=back

=head2 Why YAML

So this all started as a way to make a decision tree thats easy to parse and
easy to read for non-programmers. So to do this I looked to YAML, it's easy
to read and easy to parse. Though make this work we have some hard and fast 
rules to follow for the tree construction:

=over

=item * RULES are a key value pair

=over

=item * the key is the method to run in the rules object

=item * the value must be an arrayref or hashref

=back

=item * ARRAYS are a series of rules run in order

=item * HASHES are a series of answers

=item * SCALARS are endpoints

=back

=head2 Why add more parts, why blow everything in to separate objects.

Sometimes you have to make things messy before they can get clean.

Theres a flexibility that comes with breaking things apart in to nice, neat
little chunks. By separating the rule logic in to one place you can make 
very complex rules that do not gunk up your code. You pull the order of these
rules in to another place as it's completely possible that you would want to
tweak the order. And lastly you need to glue these separate things together, 
so you have an object that gets passed thru to make this all work. Tada! 

=head2 Examples

It would be nice to whip up a big example here to show all the interesting
bits, sadly I can't think of a good example. Ideas?

=head1 FEATURES

=over

=item * tracking for free

=over

=item * if you have $obj->{parse_path} then every step that this obj takes thru
the rules then every rule name and returned value are stored as an array of hashes

=item * if you have $obj->{parse_answer} then the result will also be stored here
as well as being returned from ParseTree.

=back

=back

=head1 EXPORT

ParseTree is the only thing that gets exported, it's also the only thing here. 

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 ParseTree($tree, $rules, $obj)

Runs $obj thru $tree, using $rules as the library of rules.

Returns the first endpoint that you run into as the answer.

#===  FUNCTION  ================================================================
#         NAME:  ParseTree
#      PURPOSE:  walk a decision tree to get an answer
#   PARAMETERS:  $tree : Expected to be a big array ref of stuff pulled from YAML
#                $rules: an object of rules that holds $tree's nodes
#                $obj  : The concept is that this $obj is what is passed thru the
#                        rules. So build your rules as though $obj will be passed
#                        to them. 
#                        Also, there are two 'plugins' for $obj:
#                         $obj->{parse_path}   : if exists it will contain the path
#                                                that the $obj took
#                         $obj->{parse_answer} : if exists it will hold the result
#      RETURNS:  the proper value from $tree or undef
#       THROWS:  there are many assertions that will die on failure
#     COMMENTS:  none
#     SEE ALSO:  the pod above for an explination and example

=head1 CAVEATS / TODO

=over

=item * Currently $tree is expected to be a pre-parsed YAML File, This should 
change here soon to also accept a filename. Currently though it does not.

=item * no mention of the tracking and storeing bits.

=item * need better examples.

=item * need to flush out the docs more.
